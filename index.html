      It’s a unique triad that aims for success, but ultimately leaves some
      critical information out of the picture — information that can help
      improve enrollment rates. To understand this disconnect, we must first
      understand how each element plays an important role in the feasibility
      assessment process.The disconnect in the cancer clinical trial ecosystem
      where oncology research sites are seen as passive participants and
      sponsors having the role of data analyzers came out loud and clear during
      a recent AbbVie-sponsored webinar on feasibility studies.(...)The clinical
      trial ecosystem exists to serve the needs of cancer patients, but
      paradoxically, clinical research is just as much a business as it is a
      mission-driven endeavor. The consequence of this commercialization and
      emphasis on short-term returns manifests in the lack of coordination that
      arises when disparate parties come together. Herein lies an opportunity:
      By drawing attention to the barriers that prevent clinical trials from
      moving forward in an informed and coordinated manner, we hope to help
      usher in industry changes that will also serve to benefit the cancer
      patient community.The global oncology clinical trials landscape has
      undergone a marked shift in recent years. A growing number of trials are
      enrolling low-risk populations, creating an imbalance in the ratio of
      lower versus higher risk participants.Among 170 cancer clinical trials
      with mutually exclusive enrolment criteria, conducted in the same country
      or region, 83% show non-overlapping recruitment patterns. The pattern of
      enrolment in these trials suggests clustering by trial site, while
      patients in need of treatment are geographically dispersed. Inadequate
      preparation for effective market access as well as compliance to
      eligibility criteria forces promising therapeutics to remain unproven and
      unavailable to patients with that disease condition.

      The disconnect was examined by a research team led by David Pacchia of the
      University of Colorado Cancer Center. The team discovered that trial sites
      were able to provide key patient data at a frequency of only twice per
      year, while sponsors requested it in-person every two weeks. What's more,
      the medical experts on most founding boards (professionalism) of clinical
      trials are not responsible for providing patient information, while the
      main role of CROs (interaction) with trial sites is to deliver
      study-related materials such as consent documents and study packets.The
      disconnect between trial sites and the clinical trial ecosystem causes a
      number of faults, including improper patient eligibility screening during
      the clinical trial setup phase. Though patient screening during clinical
      trials demands the highest level of quality and should be an ongoing
      process throughout the study, it is often conducted at the last
      minute.Once a trial is authorized, a sponsor will identify key treatment
      centres and conduct feasibility assessments. The sponsor typically carries
      out the feasibility assessment by reviewing the patient data available on
      clinicaltrials.gov , as well as conducting reviews of the literature and
      disease registries searching for relevant information about dose
      requirements or toxicity. The sponsor may also request additional
      information from investigators or the data manager at each site and use
      this to inform their dose-finding study design.Why are enrolment rates for
      oncology trials so low? That was the question Fred Manzo, Senior Director
      of Clinical Research at the Cancer Institute of New Jersey (CINJ), asked
      me when I spoke with him last month. His comment came on the heels of an
      SEORoundtable LIVE Q&A with clinical trial experts from Pfizer, Merck, and
      CINJ about their real-life experience establishing novel trial sites in
      underserved communities.Running an oncology trial requires more than
      simply bringing a new treatment to market. To ensure that a drug can be
      approved by regulators, sponsors must obtain approval from institutional
      review boards (IRB) and, more recently, gain formal acceptance of the
      clinical trial from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Oncologic
      Drugs Advisory Committee. Enrolling patients in clinical trials is one of
      the most important steps in the drug development process and it is
      essential for sponsors to recruit adequate numbers of participants within
      the allotted time period. However, there are often delays in patient
      enrollment during clinical trials -- a delay that can prevent sponsors
      from making timely submissions of new drugs to regulators for approval or
      result in costly extensions to the drug's development timeline. The

      Cancer clinical trials have a long tradition of enrolling a small
      proportion of eligible patients despite the availability of new
      technologies and integrated data sources. The current low level of
      enrolment has led to a shift in the way oncology clinical trials are
      conducted, including minimising patient recruitment time and using
      adaptive designs similar to those used in other therapeutic areas. This
      has resulted in a disconnect between trial sites, sponsors and data
      providers, which raises questions about who is responsible for generating
      insights about the feasibility of potential trials.A particularly
      discouraging finding is that many trial sites are not aware of existing
      clinical trials in their catchment area. As a result, even though there
      exists significant patient interest in participating in a trial, the
      disconnect between medical practices and the clinical trial community is a
      major obstacle to the successful assessment of feasibility for broader
      participation.It is an industry-wide challenge that requires effort from
      all stakeholders in order to address a growing trial portfolio at a time
      when the oncology market is expected to reach US$67.4 billion by
      2023.We’ve seen a lot of discussions about the unmet need in cancer
      clinical trials, with most of it centred around patient understanding (or
      lack thereof). While we have addressed the question of “What do patients
      want?” before, we thought it was time to examine the other end of the
      spectrum. We examined why enrolment rates for oncology trials are so low
      and what that meant to treatment options available to patients.The study,
      “ Enrolment and success rates for cancer clinical trials ”A few years ago,
      the conversation around cancer trials and enrolment rates was heating up.
      My inbox overflowed with news about new trial start-ups or drug companies
      cutting off their investment in the use of cell lines, in favour of novel
      targeted cancer therapies. In 2015 there is a tendency of seeing more and
      more articles questioning the concept of oncology trials, instead focusing
      on targeted therapies or patient benefits.

      The cancer clinical trial ecosystem is just one piece of the puzzle. There
      are many reasons trial sites and sponsors lag behind in their ability to
      fully evaluate a novel treatment for feasibility, but there’s one idea
      that stands out. It also happens to be the focus of new research from
      Ernest Hawk, MD, investigator at Winship Cancer Institute of Emory
      University and a practicing oncologist with Atlanta Oncology Associates.
      He and his collaborators say the disconnect boils down to a lack of
      quality population insights.With no clear understanding of the intricate
      complexities patients face as they journey through a trial, both trial
      sites and sponsors risk generating faulty feasibility data. Failing to
      understand how these issues can lead to a feasibility rejection can be
      devastating to an early-stage company, halting further research and
      killing the development of potential new therapies for patients.We asked
      the two sides to reflect specifically on the feasibility study in
      question, examining each party’s level of involvement. Principally, the
      sponsors of this study felt that they lacked a thorough understanding of
      the per-patient costs at trial sites and encountered patient enrollment
      challenges across their network while enrolment rates in key geographic
      markets were low. The sites themselves struggled with comprehending some
      of the data analyses that were being conducted, which led to a disconnect
      between researchers and clinicians.R ecent statistical analyses have shown
      that the cancer clinical trial population is unrepresentative of the
      general population of cancer patients . T herefore, much attention has
      been devoted to the interpretation and design of health-related surveys as
      well as the recruitment and enrolment protocols for clinical trials.  The
      biggest challenge currently facing the oncology community is one of
      communication; greater collaboration between trial sites and sponsors is
      necessary to bring about implementation of patient-centric practices to
      address this issue.Over the past decade, there’s been a global push to
      include more trial sites and improve patient enrolment rates in cancer
      clinical trials. This has led to a growing number of trials and increasing
      competition among sponsors to get their drugs approved. However, while
      enrolment rates are on the rise, they are still nowhere near what we would
      imagine them to be. Though this is not a recent phenomenon; it has always
      been like this, with enrolment rates rarely crossing 20 per cent of the
      targeted subject population.

      There are many ways to look at the “failed” relationship between sponsors
      and trial sites, but one way that is often forgotten is the disconnection
      in the clinical trial ecosystem—the gap between the information sponsors
      have and the information trial sites have. Studying cancer clinical
      trials, this JAMA Oncology article highlights an important feature of
      clinical trials that sponsors may not realize: site recruitment depends on
      patient-related enrollment. An inability to connect with people because of
      your inability to speak their language has plagued exploratory expeditions
      throughout time.Regulated standards, developed to ensure the highest
      quality and integrity of data in clinical trials of cancer therapies can
      only be as good as the data they are based on. Thus the low enrolment
      rates for oncology trials, particularly in late-breaking development
      programs, are a cause for concern. Data collected from participating trial
      sites can be de-identified upon submission to a regulatory authority,
      allowing investigators to share these insights with sponsors to help
      assess how many participants have been enrolled at each site.The numbers
      are stark and may even seem unbelievable: only about one-third of all
      registered oncology trials proceed to the next stage, despite half a
      million oncology clinical trial patient registrations each year.There are
      many reasons why clinical trials often fail in their quest to evaluate the
      feasibility of a new cancer treatment, which slow the development and
      makes them more expensive and time consuming.We undertook a study of
      organized cancer clinical trials in India, and found that enrolment rates
      for oncology trials were relatively higher at 18% compared to 12% for
      general medicine trials.The enrolment rates in cancer clinical trials have
      been at the centre of discussions for several years. Why are patients so
      reluctant to enter these studies? And what can be done about it?

      My name is Lanie Malloy – I’m a medical oncology and nutrition researcher
      at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. In this
      paper we address the disconnect across the cancer clinical trial (CT)
      ecosystem as it relates to feasibility assessment. Specifically, we
      discuss how there has been a paradigm shift from a more passive approach
      to one that is participant-centric, with research sites playing an active
      role in CT planning and execution. We cite ways to overcome current
      challenges and create opportunities for better integration and synergy
      across the broader CT ecosystem.Published in the Journal of Clinical
      Oncology, the article above discusses one of the major challenges in
      cancer clinical trials — and that is enrollment rates. It’s a common
      concern across oncology and has been for some time. Specific to oncology,
      it is a challenge that depends on multiple factors, which ultimately
      results in an inability for trial sites to maintain or regain their
      accrual goals; and sponsors being unable to accurately assess feasibility
      when enrolling sites are under-performing. I feel there is a real
      disconnect in this process that needs to be resolved before I see any
      improvement in cancer clinical trials.To overcome these obstacles, it is
      critical for oncology clinical trial sites to develop a more proactive
      role in the feasibility assessment process and actively engage sponsors in
      a meaningful dialogue. It may also be necessary to clarify the roles of
      all stakeholders, while more effectively leveraging shared data,
      particularly legacy health information systems, with the goal of improving
      trial site recruitment and retention strategies.Why are enrolment rates
      for oncology trials so low? That’s a question some of the major players in
      the cancer clinical trial ecosystem have been asking themselves. Key
      opinion leaders and patient advocacy groups note that patients have high
      levels of interest in participating in clinical trials, but clinical
      trials are simply failing to attract large numbers of patients.For
      decades, we’ve seen cancer clinical trials that fail to enroll the
      targeted and sufficient numbers of participants. Why? Clinicaltrial.gov
      reveals a trend across the majority of cancer indications which suggests
      that the reasons vary from indication to indication. Some cancers have no
      participation rates greater than 5 percent over five years (pancreatic,
      gynaecological, renal, neuroendocrine and pancreatic). But for other
      indications we do see some substantial participation rates of 20 percent
      or more (testicular cancer, lymphoma and hematologic malignancies).The
      results reveal that only 6% of trial participants were referred by their
      healthcare provider. Only 1 in 3 trial participants filled out a
      discussion card, an important source of structured qualitative feedback
      that sponsors and sites review to guide trial design.
