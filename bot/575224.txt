There are multiple elements that typically take part in a feasibility assessment for new oncology trials: trial sites (oncology centers that are selected to enroll patients), sponsors (typically pharmaceutical companies) and data partners (usually CROs). The objective of the feasibility study is to collect real-world data with the goal of answering the question, "Is this treatment safe and/or effective?"The roadblock to sustainable growth of oncology clinical trials rests in the weak integration of data partners and trial sites.There is a clear disconnect in the clinical trial ecosystem that needs to be corrected for more cancer trials to gain patient enrolment.With the low percentage of feasible trial sites (15% in developed markets; 4%-8% in emerging markets), the clinical trial feasibility assessment (CTFA) process is facing a stalemate. Trial feasibility assessments have become the hot topic for a number of major challenges to clinical trials, including declining enrollment rates and failed studies due to risk-averse sponsors and vulnerable trial sites facing steep competition.The fact that most sites are unable to identify and engage patients who might benefit from a particular trial, or even conduct a recruitment drive on their own is surprising to an outsider. But it’s actually something the industry has grown used to and has accepted as the status quo.The role of sponsors in cancer clinical research has evolved over the years, most notably with the emergence of surrogate endpoints in clinical studies. This has resulted in a greater focus on feasibility assessments as opposed to traditional confirmatory trials. Concurrently, the increasing burden on patients of modern cancer therapies and medical costs have become a global public health concern, forcing investigators to seek alternative methods such as biosimilars for avoiding drug related toxicity and reducing overall healthcare costs through economic evaluations.
