A disconnect in the cancer clinical trial ecosystem stands out as a key factor impeding successful feasibility assessment. Trial sites typically assume the role of the passive participant unable to translate key patient data into cogent insights, while sponsors conduct their feasibility studies with the help of data partners that lack quality population insights.A recent study published in the journal Neoplasia shines light on a key factor impeding successful feasibility assessment of cancer clinical trials. Clinical trial sites, typically academic medical centers (AMCs), play a critical role in the early phases of understanding whether or not combination therapies will be feasible in the target population. Trial sites are generally thought to be unable to translate key patient data into cogent insights due to a lack of incentives and available analytical tools. Consequently, sponsors conduct their feasibility studies with the help of data partners that possess high-quality population intelligence but lack the clinical trial expertise needed to track emerging safety signals. In turn, this disconnect between trial sites and sponsors affects the ability of both parties to yield positive feasibility results – namely a consent rate above 30The lack of a robust data ecosystem focused on facilitating the flow of clinical trial data for the use of both sponsors and sites is a key factor that inhibits successful feasibility assessment.The disconnect between sponsors and trial sites should be resolved by plugging in population insights ; which, in turn, can be ensured by the triage methodology iCancerTrial.com is focused on.Study selection is important in the feasibility assessment of a clinical trial. But the way feasibility is conducted varies from a one-to-one interest match between sponsor and sites to approaches that implement a variety of investigative tools to streamline study candidacy assessment.  The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility assessment approaches used by sponsor and site decision makers in early phase clinical trials, with special focus on the utility of data partners in feasibility assessments.This article aims to help trial sites regain their voice and better engage sponsors through crowdsourcing clinical data.
