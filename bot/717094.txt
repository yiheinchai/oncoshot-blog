Trial sites typically assume the role of the passive participant unable to translate key patient data into cogent insights, while sponsors conduct their feasibility studies with the help of data partners that lack quality population insights.The oncology clinical trial ecosystem comprises a wide array of participants whose interests don’t always align to provide an optimal information flow through the study.Oncology trialists and sponsors should take steps to actively engage potential study sites and provide incentives for sharing their data about patient demographics, symptoms and treatment history.There is an unavoidable need for patient-focused feasibility methodologies that directly engage the clinical trial investigator and enable them to acquire high-quality data from potential patients and deliver it in a timely fashion.We recently published a blog post on our sister blog The Oncology Trial Blog that sought to answer a simple question: why are enrolment rates for oncology trials so low? This was prompted by an interesting statistic we came across from the CenterWatch Oncology Clinical Trials Landscape Report 2017. This report outlines the primary challenges faced by oncology clinical trial sponsors and the demand side of the recruitment supply chain.
