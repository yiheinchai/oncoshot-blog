A disconnect in the oncology clinical trial ecosystem stands out as a key factor impeding successful feasibility assessment. Trial sites typically assume the role of the passive participant unable to translate key patient data into cogent insights, while sponsors conduct their feasibility studies with the help of data partners that lack quality population insights.The cancer clinical trial ecosystem is comprised of trial sites, sponsors, and so-called data partners. It’s a unique triad that aims for success, but ultimately leaves some critical information out of the picture — information that can help improve enrollment rates. To understand this disconnect, we must first understand how each element plays an important role in the feasibility assessment process.The disconnect in the cancer clinical trial ecosystem where oncology research sites are seen as passive participants and sponsors having the role of data analyzers came out loud and clear during a recent AbbVie-sponsored webinar on feasibility studies.(...)The clinical trial ecosystem exists to serve the needs of cancer patients, but paradoxically, clinical research is just as much a business as it is a mission-driven endeavor. The consequence of this commercialization and emphasis on short-term returns manifests in the lack of coordination that arises when disparate parties come together. Herein lies an opportunity: By drawing attention to the barriers that prevent clinical trials from moving forward in an informed and coordinated manner, we hope to help usher in industry changes that will also serve to benefit the cancer patient community.The global oncology clinical trials landscape has undergone a marked shift in recent years. A growing number of trials are enrolling low-risk populations, creating an imbalance in the ratio of lower versus higher risk participants.Among 170 cancer clinical trials with mutually exclusive enrolment criteria, conducted in the same country or region, 83% show non-overlapping recruitment patterns. The pattern of enrolment in these trials suggests clustering by trial site, while patients in need of treatment are geographically dispersed. Inadequate preparation for effective market access as well as compliance to eligibility criteria forces promising therapeutics to remain unproven and unavailable to patients with that disease condition.
