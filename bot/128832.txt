Cancer clinical trials have a long tradition of enrolling a small proportion of eligible patients despite the availability of new technologies and integrated data sources. The current low level of enrolment has led to a shift in the way oncology clinical trials are conducted, including minimising patient recruitment time and using adaptive designs similar to those used in other therapeutic areas. This has resulted in a disconnect between trial sites, sponsors and data providers, which raises questions about who is responsible for generating insights about the feasibility of potential trials.A particularly discouraging finding is that many trial sites are not aware of existing clinical trials in their catchment area. As a result, even though there exists significant patient interest in participating in a trial, the disconnect between medical practices and the clinical trial community is a major obstacle to the successful assessment of feasibility for broader participation.It is an industry-wide challenge that requires effort from all stakeholders in order to address a growing trial portfolio at a time when the oncology market is expected to reach US$67.4 billion by 2023.We’ve seen a lot of discussions about the unmet need in cancer clinical trials, with most of it centred around patient understanding (or lack thereof). While we have addressed the question of “What do patients want?” before, we thought it was time to examine the other end of the spectrum. We examined why enrolment rates for oncology trials are so low and what that meant to treatment options available to patients.The study, “ Enrolment and success rates for cancer clinical trials ”A few years ago, the conversation around cancer trials and enrolment rates was heating up. My inbox overflowed with news about new trial start-ups or drug companies cutting off their investment in the use of cell lines, in favour of novel targeted cancer therapies. In 2015 there is a tendency of seeing more and more articles questioning the concept of oncology trials, instead focusing on targeted therapies or patient benefits.
