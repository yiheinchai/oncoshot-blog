There are many ways to look at the “failed” relationship between sponsors and trial sites, but one way that is often forgotten is the disconnection in the clinical trial ecosystem—the gap between the information sponsors have and the information trial sites have. Studying cancer clinical trials, this JAMA Oncology article highlights an important feature of clinical trials that sponsors may not realize: site recruitment depends on patient-related enrollment. An inability to connect with people because of your inability to speak their language has plagued exploratory expeditions throughout time.Regulated standards, developed to ensure the highest quality and integrity of data in clinical trials of cancer therapies can only be as good as the data they are based on. Thus the low enrolment rates for oncology trials, particularly in late-breaking development programs, are a cause for concern. Data collected from participating trial sites can be de-identified upon submission to a regulatory authority, allowing investigators to share these insights with sponsors to help assess how many participants have been enrolled at each site.The numbers are stark and may even seem unbelievable: only about one-third of all registered oncology trials proceed to the next stage, despite half a million oncology clinical trial patient registrations each year.There are many reasons why clinical trials often fail in their quest to evaluate the feasibility of a new cancer treatment, which slow the development and makes them more expensive and time consuming.We undertook a study of organized cancer clinical trials in India, and found that enrolment rates for oncology trials were relatively higher at 18% compared to 12% for general medicine trials.The enrolment rates in cancer clinical trials have been at the centre of discussions for several years. Why are patients so reluctant to enter these studies? And what can be done about it?
